# Python-Lessons

This is a collection of Python Coding Lessons that I have developed for my role as a coding instructor. Most of the lessons are beginner friendly and can be scaled.

Some lessons use [Python Turtle Graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html). Note that to run these, you will need to have installed the [Tk interface package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter).

For a quick and convenient way to run the programs, links are also provided to the project files on [Replit](https://replit.com/), where they can be easily forked.
